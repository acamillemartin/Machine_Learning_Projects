## Overview

This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory purposes. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

In this project, I have implemented the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify iris flowers based on their features, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Algorithms Used

- K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results

- **K-nearest Neighbors (KNN):** 
  - Achieved a classification accuracy of 97.7.
  - Evaluated the performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
